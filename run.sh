### Current Directory
CURRENT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )"
CONTAINER_DIR='/var/www/site'

### User will run: `./run.sh <site-name>`

### Setup Goals:
# 1. Check if wp folder is empty - if so, download wp
# 2. Check if <site-name> was passed. If not, ask for one
# 3. Check if themes/<site-name> exists. If not, ask if they
#   - ask if they will use version-controlled theme or downloaded theme?
#   - if version-controlled: ask for a git remote url so we can add as a submodule - also ask what branch to use
# 4. Check if wp-engine-downloads/<site-name> exists. If not, tell them to download from wp-engine & run again when complete.
# 5. Check if wp-engine-downloads/<site-name>/themes/<site-name> exists (and not using themes/<site-name>).
#   - If not, tell them to download from wp-engine or make sure name of theme matches & run again when complete.
# 6. Check if wp-engine-downloads/<site-name>/mysql.sql exists - if not tell them to put it there (can get from wp-engine via SFTP).
# 7. Install DockerLocal as a submodule - ask what version of PHP to use. Branch will be PHP-<version>

### Swap Site: Check folders exist, and swap.
# 1. If wp-engine-downloads/<site-name>/plugins
#  - clear and/or replace html/wp-content/plugins contents with wp-engine-downloads/<site-name>/wp-content/plugins
# 2. Repeat for: mu-plugins & uploads
# 3. If themes/<site-name> exists, replace html/themes/<site-name> with contents of themes/<site-name>
#  - check if themes/<site-name>/<site-name> exists to use that one instead (nested theme folder inside submodule repo)
# 4. else if wp-engine-downloads/<site-name>/themes exists, replace html/themes/<site-name> with contents of wp-engine-downloads/<site-name>/themes

### Database & Run:
# 1. Copy wp-engine-downloads/<site-name>/mysql.sql to DockerLocal/data/dumps/<site-name>.import.sql if not exists.
#  - if not, tell them to get it and run again. exit.
#  - If it does exist, check if the database file exists in DockerLocal/database - if not (dockerlocal has never ran) - skip
#  - If it does exist, check if the database file exists in DockerLocal/database - if so, then check if the database exists in the container via list command
#  - If it does exist, change the DockerLocal/database file to have contents <site-name> in it. and run ./site-up
#  - If it does not exist, continue...
# 2. cd DockerLocal/commands and run ./site-up -c=<site-name>
# 3. cd DockerLocal/commands and run ./site-db -i=<site-name> -f=<site-name>import.sql
